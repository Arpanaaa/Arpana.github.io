‘Mental health’ is the health which is rarely talked about in our society. It includes emotional, social, cognitive, psychological wellbeing and affects the way we think, feel and behave. Yet, the society still takes mental health problems indifferently. If someone suffers from mental illness, they are still directly tagged as “mad” and a psychiatrist is considered to be the doctor who treats "mad" people. Even today, people have failed to understand the severity of mental health issues. 

There are various factors that contribute to the mental health of a person. As an individual spends a significant amount of their time in the workplace, a workplace should be a place that fosters mental peace and well-being. Thus, mental well-being in the workplace is essential to create a positive and productive atmosphere.
