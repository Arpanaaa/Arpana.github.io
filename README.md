‘Mental health’ is the health which is rarely talked about in our society. It includes emotional, social, cognitive, psychological wellbeing and affects the way we think, feel and behave. Yet, the society still takes mental health problems indifferently. If someone suffers from mental illness, they are still directly tagged as “mad” and a psychiatrist is considered to be the doctor who treats "mad" people. Even today, people have failed to understand the severity of mental health issues. 

There are various factors that contribute to the mental health of a person. As an individual spends a significant amount of their time in the workplace, a workplace should be a place that fosters mental peace and well-being. Thus, mental well-being in the workplace is essential to create a positive and productive atmosphere.

Various surveys have been conducted by Open Sourcing Mental Health (OSMI) which is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. The data collected from one of its 'Mental Health in Workplace' survey has been analyzed in this data analysis.  

**Dataset**

The dataset has been retrieved from Kaggle. Around 1260 responses from the survey has been amalgamated to form this dataset. Though most of the survey respondents are from USA, this dataset measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. It contains various information regarding the respondents of the survey. The age, gender, country and the state the respondent lives in. The type of business they are involved in, their family history of mental illness, if they have taken treatment or not, if they have received mental health benefits or not, if they can discuss about mental health with their employer or not, etc. for each respondent. In order to simplify the process of analysis, the data has been cleaned and wrangled. 

**Objective of the Analysis**
<br>
*The main objective of this data analysis is to comprehend the attitude towards 'Mental Health' in the workplace and also understand 'Mental Health at Workplace' in general.*

**Process of Analysis**
Exploratory Data Analsyis (EDA) has been done using Python, in order to comprehend the perception of mental health among the survey respondents. Visualization has also been done using various libraries in Python itself. 

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

***Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?***

According to the above graph, the percentage of people who want to get treatment for mental health conditions is 50% and the percentage of respondents who do not want to get treatment is also 50%. This shows the stigma that is associated with mental illness. 50% of the people do not want to get treatment even when they are suffering from mental health problems. On the brighter side, 50% of the people who want to get treatment can be supported in the workplace. A workplace that promotes mental health is not only likely to have increased productivity but also joyous employees. 

***Do you have a family history of mental illness?***

39% of the people responded that they have a family history of mental illness and 61% of the people did not have a family history of mental illness. People in general have a perception that if a family suffers from mental illness, the child is also likely to suffer from mental health condition. Rather, a family with history of mental illness will pay more attention to mental illness due to which children born in a family with history of mental illness is more likely not to suffer from mental health condition. Thus, family history can be considered a  risk factor for many mental health disorders.

***Are you self-employed?***

The above graph depicts the percentage of people who are self employed and who are not. Most of the people who responded to the survey were working for an organization as only 12% of the respondents were self employed. There is a also vast difference between the number of people who seek treatment. More than 500 people who worked in organizations seeked mental health treatment rather than people who are self employed, according to the above graph. But since more employees filled the survey, it cannot be concluded that self employed people do not seek mental health treatment. 

***Is your employer primarily a tech company/organization?***

Although the survey was designed to be conducted in the tech field, 18% of the companies belonged to the non tech field. The main reason why the survey was conducted in the tech field was because according to British Interactive Media Association (BIMA), tech workers are five times more likely to suffer from a mental health problems as compared to the wider population. Whether or not a person belongs to the tech field, mental health of an individual is important and mental-wellbeing in the workplace is a must.

***Do you work remotely (outside of an office) at least 50% of the time?***

![image](https://github.com/Arpanaaa/Arpana.github.io/assets/159395386/e1fe42c4-211f-46cb-ab73-11de5969812e)

Around 70% of the respondents of the survey do not work remotely. They work in an office. We can infer that the biggest factor of mental health disorder can be triggered on the workplace. 

***If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?***

The first graph above tells us that around 48% of people say that sometimes their mental health interferes with their work. In the second graph, the people who chose 'Sometimes' are the people who actually have a mental health condition. People who belong to the 'Often' category also consist of the people that have a mental health condition. Another interesting insight that can be seen is that people whose mental health has 'Never' interfered at work, they still want treatment to be done. This shows how mental health is important to an individual. 

***Has your employer ever discussed mental health as part of an employee wellness program?***

When respondents were asked if their employer has ever discussed about mental health being a part of employee wellness program. About 19% of the people responded that mental health was becoming a part of the employee wellness program. A shocking revealation was made that more than 65% of people responded that there were not any wellness programs provided by their company. The lack of wellness programs in an organization could decrease employee productivity and morale, increase absenteeism and also lack retention of employees. 

***Does your employer provide mental health benefits?***

38% of the poeople said that their employer provided them mental health benefits, whereas 32% of them did not even know whether they were provided this benefit. The 38% of people who said their employer provided them mental health benefits shows that even employers are aware of mental well-being due to which they even provide mental health benefits to their employees. 

***Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?***

![image](https://github.com/Arpanaaa/Arpana.github.io/assets/159395386/4035f83c-31e2-4af3-b5e2-afd3cf953e4c)

Around 39% of the people responded as 'No' and 38% of the people responded as'Maybe' for the negative impact of discussing mental health consequences with the employer and about 23% said 'Yes' to it. 23% is a significant number of people who feel that discussing their mental health with the employer might create an impact on their job. This may be because of the stigma or any other preconcieved notion that people create when talking about mental health. 

***Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?***

![image](https://github.com/Arpanaaa/Arpana.github.io/assets/159395386/7fc0c285-d43a-4b18-b06a-6f61503957fe)

The respondents answers to the same question on physical and mental health fluctuate dramatically. Only 5% of workers think that their physical health has a negative impact on their employer, compared to more than 70% who think physical health does not have any detrimental impact on the employer. This shows that people believe discussing physical health with the employer does not have any negative consequences but discussing mental health could have negative consequences. 

***Have you heard of or observed negative consequences for coworkers with mental health conditions in your workplace?***

![image](https://github.com/Arpanaaa/Arpana.github.io/assets/159395386/063014fa-77d2-4174-84ea-a5fb40a50614)

85% of the people said that they have not observed any negative consequence for coworkers with mental health conditions. This result could be due to IT being an organised sector that follows strict guidelines of employee satisfaction in countries like USA or it could also be due to the increasing awareness of mental health and mental health conditions. 

***Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your coworkers?***

According to the above chart, around 62% of the employees felt comfortable in discussing some type of mental problems with their coworkers whereas 20% of the employees believed that discussing mental health with their coworkers was not a good idea for them. People are comfortable in discussing mental health issues with their coworkers but are not with their employers. 

*** Do Employers take Mental Health as seriously as Physical Health?***

50% of the people from the survey said they do not know if employers take mental health as seriously as physical health.  The number of people who answered 'Yes' as well as 'No' were completely equal in the survey. A concrete conclusion on whether employers take mental health as seriously as physical health cannot be made based on the above graph.
