‘Mental health’ is the health which is rarely talked about in our society. It includes emotional, social, cognitive, psychological wellbeing and affects the way we think, feel and behave. Yet, the society still takes mental health problems indifferently. If someone suffers from mental illness, they are still directly tagged as “mad” and a psychiatrist is considered to be the doctor who treats "mad" people. Even today, people have failed to understand the severity of mental health issues. 

There are various factors that contribute to the mental health of a person. As an individual spends a significant amount of their time in the workplace, a workplace should be a place that fosters mental peace and well-being. Thus, mental well-being in the workplace is essential to create a positive and productive atmosphere.

A survey was conducted by Open Sourcing Mental Health (OSMI) which is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. The data collected from the survey has been analyzed. 

**Dataset**

The dataset measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. It contains various information regarding the respondents of the survey. The age, gender, country and the state the respondent lives in. The type of business they are involved in, their family history of mental illness, if they have taken treatment or not, if they receive mental health benefits or not, if they easily get medical leaves for mental health condittions or not and many more information regarding the respondent.
