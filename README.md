‘Mental health’ is the health which is rarely talked about in our society. It includes emotional, social, cognitive, psychological wellbeing and affects the way we think, feel and behave. Yet, the society still takes mental health problems indifferently. If someone suffers from mental illness, they are still directly tagged as “mad” and a psychiatrist is considered to be the doctor who treats "mad" people. Even today, people have failed to understand the severity of mental health issues. 

There are various factors that contribute to the mental health of a person. As an individual spends a significant amount of their time in the workplace, a workplace should be a place that fosters mental peace and well-being. Thus, mental well-being in the workplace is essential to create a positive and productive atmosphere.

A survey was conducted by Open Sourcing Mental Health (OSMI) which is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. The data collected from the survey has been analyzed. 

**Dataset**

The dataset measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. It contains various information regarding the respondents of the survey. The age, gender, country and the state the respondent lives in. The type of business they are involved in, their family history of mental illness, if they have taken treatment or not, if they receive mental health benefits or not, if they easily get medical leaves for mental health condittions or not and many more information regarding the respondent.

***Company Category***

Although the survey was designed to be conducted in the tech field, 18% of the companies belonged to the non tech field. 

***Percentage of People who want to Get Treatment for Mental Health Conditions***

The percentage of people who want to get treatment for mental health conditions is 50% and the percentage of respondents who do not want to get treatment is also 50%. 

***Employment Type of People and Employee Type of Employees Seeking Treatment***

The percentage of people who are self employed and who are not. Most of the people who responded to the survey were working for an organization as only 12% of the respondents were self employed. There is a vast difference between the number of people who seek treatment. More than 500 people who worked in organizations seeked mental health treatment rather than people who are self employed. But since more employees filled the survey, it cannot be concluded that self employed people do not seek mental health treatment. 

***Work Interference due to Mental Health Conditions***

The first graph above tells us that around 48% of people say that sometimes work interefers with their mental health. In the second graph, the people who chose 'Sometimes' are the people who actually have a mental health condition. People who belong to the 'Often' category also consist of the people have a mental health condition. Another interesting insight that can be seen is that people whose mental health has 'Never' interfered at work, they still want treatment to be done. 

***Family History of Mental Illness***

39% of the people responded that they have a family history of mental illness. The plot shows that those people significantly want to get treatment rather than without a family history. This also clears a perception that if a family suffers from mental illness, the child is also likely to suufer from mental health condition. Rather, this statement proves the fact that people with a family history pay more attention to mental illness due to which children born in a family with mental illness is more likely not to suffer from mental health condition. Family history is a significant risk factor for many mental health disorders.

***Working Type of People***

Around 70% of the respondents of the survey do not work remotely. We can infer that the biggest factor of mental health disorder can be triggered on the workplace. 

***Mental Health Benefits ***

38% of the poeople said that their employer provided them mental health benefits, whereas 32% of them didn't even know whether they were provided this benefit.
